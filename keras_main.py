the network is a model of the cotrical / cerebellur network
there are 15 inputs nodes that received an input vector, with 5 nodes defined
as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and 10 nodes deinfed as the environmental
context.  the input network is initialized with random values of 1 & 0
the lower layer weights between the input and hidden layers are fixed and
only updated by the hippocampal hidden layer.  when the HHL is missing the
weights are fixed.  as such the input vector is passed directly to the cortical
hidden layer, where there is an activation function.
