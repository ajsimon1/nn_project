description: 2nd attempt at helper functions for cortical hippocampal neural
network.  the input should consist of at least 20 vectors per trial and least
200 trials per block.  each input vector will be 15 elements with the first
5 elements referring to the conditioned stimulus and the last 10 elements
referring to the "environmental context". the environmental context is generated
once per block and maintained for the entiritey of the block.  the cs is either
'10000' correlating to 'US present' or '00000' correltating to 'US absent'.
During training the model will be given a confirmative '1' for CS '10000' and
negative '0' for CS '00000'.  The model is expected to accurately predict
the presence '1' of a US when the CS is '10000'
